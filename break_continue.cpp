// continue
// The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the current iteration of the loop and moves control back to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration.

// break
// The break statement terminates the loop entirely and transfers control to the statement immediately following the loop.


// both statements used are used to control the flow of loops(used inside loops).
