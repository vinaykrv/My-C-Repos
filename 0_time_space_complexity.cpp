// Time Complexity

// no. of opeartion kitna badh raha hai w.r.t input size incraese is time complexity.
// agar T.C O(n²) hai toh n is input size and n² is no. of operation we have to perform.

// The time complexity function describes how the number of operations grows as the input size increases.
// The more no. of operations, the longer is the time taken by algorithm.
// 10^8 operation in 1 second in modern processors.

/* Example:
For an algorithm with O(n) time complexity:

The function is n.
For input size n = 10, the number of operations is about 10.
For input size n = 100, the number of operations is about 100.
For an algorithm with O(n²) time complexity:

The function is n².
For input size n = 10, the number of operations is about 100 (10²).
For input size n = 100, the number of operations is about 10,000 (100²). */
